# Dojocho

Installable coding dojos that turn your AI agent into a sensei.

## Quick Start

```bash
# pick repo for persistence + setup your favorite coding agent & editor
dojo setup

# add your ryu/school you want to study
dojo add effect-ts

# run /kata and let you agent run you through some excercises
claude "/kata"
```

## Special thanks to

[PaulJPhilp/EffectPatterns](https://github.com/PaulJPhilp/EffectPatterns) contains 700+ Effect-TS patterns - highly useful on it's own but this guy also added skills which allowed me to create this in the first place
